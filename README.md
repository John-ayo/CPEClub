# Week 1 Projects

## Project 1: Cramer's Rule Solver

Solves a 2x2 system of linear equations using Cramer's Rule.

### What it does
Takes six values from the user and calculates x and y in this format:
```
ax + by = e
cx + dy = f
```

### How it works
- User inputs a, b, c, d, e, f
- Calculates main determinant D = (a x d) - (b x c)
- If D = 0, prints an error and exits
- Otherwise calculates Dx, Dy, then solves for x and y

### Edge Case
If D = 0 the program catches it and exits cleanly without crashing.

---

## Project 2: Mini Calculator

Performs basic arithmetic between two numbers using an operator selected by the user.

### What it does
Takes two numbers and an operator then returns the result.

### Supported operators
```
+  addition
-  subtraction
*  multiplication
/  division
```

### Edge Cases
- Division by zero prints an error instead of crashing
- Invalid operator prints an error message

---

## Project 3: Even/Odd Checker

Classifies any whole number as either Even or Odd using the modulo operator.

### How it works
- User enters a whole number
- Program runs number % 2
- If remainder is 0 it prints Even, otherwise it prints Odd

# Week 2 Projects

## Project 1: Mini Firewall (Packet Filtering)

### Objective
A firewall that filters and orders network packets based on priority and sequence.

### How it works
- Reads 10 packets from a `packets.txt` file
- Each packet has a serial number and a priority (1 being highest, 10 being lowest)
- Outputs serial numbers ordered by highest priority, then by lowest serial number for ties

### How to run
```bash
gcc firewall.c -o firewall
./firewall
```

### Input format (packets.txt)
```
1, 5
10, 1
3, 2
7, 1
4, 3
```

### Output
```
Filtered Packet Order:
SerialNo: 7  | Priority: 1
SerialNo: 10 | Priority: 1
SerialNo: 3  | Priority: 2
SerialNo: 4  | Priority: 3
SerialNo: 1  | Priority: 5
```

## Project 2: Shell-Based Phonebook

### How it works
- Uses a Contact struct with fixed-size character arrays
- All functions receive a pointer to the contact instead of the full struct
- Supports adding, searching, deleting, and listing contacts

### How to run
```bash
gcc phonebook.c -o phonebook
./phonebook
```

### Features
- Add a contact
- Search by name
- Delete a contact
- List all contacts

---

## Project 3: Substitution Cipher Tool

### Objective
Encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting each character's ASCII value using a key.

### How it works
- Accepts a string and an integer key
- Uses a pointer to walk through the string in memory
- Shifts each character's ASCII value by the key to encrypt or reverse it to decrypt

### How to run
```bash
gcc ciphertool.c -o ciphertool
./ciphertool
```

### Example
```
Choice: 1
Enter message: hello
Enter key: 3
Encrypted: khoor

Choice: 2
Enter message: khoor
Enter key: 3
Decrypted: hello
```

# Week 4 Projects

## Project 1: Dynamic Multiplication Grid

### Objective
A terminal program that takes a grid size from the user and generates a perfectly aligned n x n multiplication table.

### How it works
- Prompts the user for a grid size and validates that it is greater than zero
- Uses nested loops to compute and print every cell value
- Formats output with aligned column and row labels
- Displays total cells computed and the time complexity at the end

### Algorithm
This program applies **O(n²) nested iteration** from Big O notation.
- Outer loop handles rows: O(n)
- Inner loop handles columns: O(n) per row
- Combined: O(n²) total operations

Reference: *Grokking Algorithms, 2nd Edition* by Aditya Bhargava, Chapter 1.

### How to run
```bash
gcc multiplication_grid.c -o multiplication_grid
./multiplication_grid
```

### Sample output
```
Enter grid size (must be greater than 0): 5

          Col 1   Col 2   Col 3   Col 4   Col 5
        ----------------------------------------
Row 1   |      1       2       3       4       5
Row 2   |      2       4       6       8      10
Row 3   |      3       6       9      12      15
Row 4   |      4       8      12      16      20
Row 5   |      5      10      15      20      25

Grid size: 5 x 5 | Total cells computed: 25
Time complexity: O(n^2) where n = 5
```

## Project 2: Student Information Management System (SIMS)

### Objective
A terminal-based student records system that supports full CRUD operations, bulk file import, and file export.

### How it works
- Stores all records in a fixed-size array of structs (up to 100 students)
- Each record holds first name, last name, roll number, CGPA, and five course IDs
- Searches use linear search (O(n)) since records are added and deleted freely
- Deleting a record shifts all subsequent elements one position back in the array

### Algorithm design

| Operation | Algorithm | Time Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| Add student | Array insert at end | O(1) |
| Find by roll / name | Linear search | O(n) |
| Delete student | Array shift-left | O(n) |
| Update student | Linear search + in-place edit | O(n) |
| Bulk import | Sequential file read | O(n) |
| Export all | Sequential array scan | O(n) |

Reference: *Grokking Algorithms, 2nd Edition* by Aditya Bhargava, Chapters 1 and 2.

### How to run
```bash
gcc sims.c -o sims
./sims
```

Place `students.txt` in the same folder as the executable before using the Bulk Import option.

### Text file format (students.txt)
```
FirstName LastName RollNumber CGPA Course1 Course2 Course3 Course4 Course5
```

Sample:
```
Billo Doe 101 4.2 10 11 12 13 14
Amara Smith 102 4.8 10 15 16 17 18
Emmanuel Okon 103 3.9 11 12 19 20 21
Precious Nnamdi 104 4.5 10 13 14 22 23
```

### Menu options

| Option | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Add Student Details (Manual Input) |
| 2 | Bulk Import Students (Read from students.txt) |
| 3 | Download All Students (Write to database_backup.txt) |
| 4 | Find Student by Roll Number |
| 5 | Find Student by First Name |
| 6 | Delete Student by Roll Number |
| 7 | Update Student by Roll Number |
| 8 | Display All Students in Memory |
| 9 | Exit |

# Week 5 Projects

## Project 1: Number Guessing Game

A terminal game where the computer holds a hidden number and the player guesses until they get it right.

### How it works
- A hidden number is set between 1 and 20
- Player keeps guessing until they match it
- Program tells them if each guess is too high or too low
- Attempt count is tracked and shown when the player wins

### How to run
```bash
python guessing_game.py
```

### Example output
```
Guess a number between 1 and 20: 15
Too high! Try again.
Guess a number between 1 and 20: 5
Too low! Try again.
Guess a number between 1 and 20: 7
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 tries!
```
